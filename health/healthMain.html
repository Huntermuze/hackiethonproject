              You sound like you've put in the yards. Your brain is numb from all the tedious number crunching work generously provides, and your overall morale has receded more than
            Elon Musk's 90s hairline. I think its time you took this moment to care for your physical and mental health. You can thank me later.

              WorkMate's wellbeing mode was designed with your emotional, social and physical wellbeing at the forefront of our minds. Each feature embedded
            within the cards below serves to aid your working from home experience, ensuring that your mind and body are truly being treated as "a temple".
            This way, the next time your boss decides to cut your pay, you'll have the physical and mental stamina to take your services to a multi-billion
            dollar franchise - earning twice the pay! (if only life were this simple)...
